# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - image/01.png
    - image/icon01.png
    - image/icon02.png
    - image/icon04.png
    - image/icon12.png
    - image/noteIcon.png
    - image/logo.png
    - image/me.png
    - image/me-active.png
    - image/home.png
    - image/home-active.png
    - image/explore.png
    - image/explore-active.png
    - image/category.png
    - image/category-active.png
    - image/banner/banner01.png
    - image/banner/banner02.png
    - image/banner/banner03.png
    - image/banner/banner04.png
    - image/recommend01.png
    - image/recommend02.png
    - image/recommend03.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#    - family: Raleway
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
#            weight:500
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-SemiBold.ttf
#            weight:600
#    - family: AbrilFatface
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/abrilfatface/AbrilFatface-Regular.ttf
fonts:
     - family: SourceHanSansCN-Bold
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/SourceHanSansCN-Bold.ttf
     - family: FontAwesome
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/FontAwesome.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
